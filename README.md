# Airbnb Pricing Dynamics: A Comprehensive Study

## Introduction

The profound impact of Airbnb on accommodation choices has prompted the need for a nuanced understanding of pricing dynamics. This project delves into the intricate factors that influence host decisions regarding listing prices, employing a robust linear regression model to unravel their impact.

## Research Question

Our investigation centers on key predictors such as bed type, number of reviews, review scores value, property type, accommodates, host response rate, guests included, bedrooms, and bathrooms. Through a linear regression model, we aim to decipher their influence on Airbnb pricing. This study aligns with course principles, utilizing precise terminology to uncover relationships within predictors and pricing structures, contributing valuable insights to Airbnb pricing dynamics.

## Linear Regression Approach

To tackle this question, we leverage a linear regression model—a powerful tool for examining the relationships between predictor variables and the response variable, in this case, the pricing of Airbnb listings. This approach assumes a linear relationship between chosen predictors and pricing. By estimating coefficients for each predictor, we gauge the strength and direction of their influence, ultimately yielding a linear equation encapsulating the relationship.

## Literature and Context

Our study builds upon and contributes to the existing body of knowledge, drawing inspiration from seminal works in the field.

1. **Guttentag et al.'s Motivations of Airbnb Users:** This study explores factors such as Interaction, Home Benefits, Novelty, Sharing Economy Ethos, and Local Authenticity. Recognizing diverse motivations provides a crucial perspective for understanding the complex world of Airbnb pricing.

2. **Wang et al.'s Trust Dynamics between Hosts and Airbnb:** Investigating trust dynamics is critical for understanding pricing decisions. This study explores antecedents of hosts' trust, shedding light on factors impacting hosts' perceptions of Airbnb’s trustworthiness.

3. **Suess et al.'s Emotional and Perceptual Dimension:** This study explores residents' perceptions of Airbnb visitors and their impact on the community. While our research focuses on pricing factors, this study underscores the multifaceted nature of Airbnb dynamics, emphasizing emotional solidarity and community impact.

## Contribution to Literature

Our investigation aims to fill the identified gap in the literature by utilizing a comprehensive linear regression model and course-appropriate terminology. By explicitly connecting insights from the cited literature to our research question, we provide a more holistic view of the factors influencing pricing in the Airbnb ecosystem. This approach ensures a deeper understanding of Airbnb pricing dynamics, bridging the existing gap in the literature.
